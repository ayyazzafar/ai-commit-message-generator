# AI Commit Message Generator

AI Commit Message Generator is a command-line tool that leverages the power of Claude AI to automatically generate informative and well-structured git commit messages based on your code changes.

## Features

- Utilizes Claude AI to analyze your git diff and create meaningful commit messages
- Generates commit messages that follow best practices (summary line + detailed bullet points)
- Automatically copies the AI-generated commit message to your clipboard for seamless integration into your workflow
- Saves time and ensures consistent, high-quality commit messages across your project

## Example Output

Here's an example of a commit message generated by this tool:

```
Implement user authentication and improve error handling

- Add user login and registration functionality
- Implement JWT-based authentication system
- Create middleware for protected routes
- Enhance error handling in API endpoints
- Update user model with password hashing
- Add input validation for user-related operations
```

This example demonstrates how the tool generates a concise summary followed by detailed bullet points, providing a clear and informative commit message.

## Prerequisites

- Git
- Bash
- curl
- jq
- Claude AI API key

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-commit-message-generator.git
   ```

2. Move the `gitm` script to a directory in your PATH (e.g., `~/bin/`):
   ```
   mv ai-commit-message-generator/gitm ~/bin/
   ```

3. Make the script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x ~/bin/gitm
   ```

4. Open the `gitm` script in a text editor and replace `"your_api_key_here"` with your actual Claude AI API key.

## Usage

1. Make changes to your git repository as usual.

2. When you're ready to commit, instead of manually writing the commit message, simply run:
   ```
   gitm
   ```

3. The script will use Claude AI to analyze your git diff, generate an intelligent commit message, and copy it to your clipboard.

4. Use the AI-generated commit message in your git commit command:
   ```
   git commit -m "$(pbpaste)"
   ```

## How It Works

1. The script captures your current git diff.
2. It sends this diff to Claude AI with a carefully crafted prompt.
3. Claude AI analyzes the changes and generates a commit message.
4. The script formats the message and copies it to your clipboard.

## Customization

You can fine-tune the AI's output by modifying the prompt in the `content` field of the `payload` variable within the `gitm` script. This allows you to adjust the style, format, or focus of the generated commit messages to better suit your project's needs.
